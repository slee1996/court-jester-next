        This world was built for art<br />
        The vivid forests and pastel seas<br />
        Painted by the hand of god unseen<br />
        The slow rivers brought to life in a single brush stroke<br />
        Lazily meandering across the canvas and splitting the earth in two<br />
        Bushes stipple the landscape<br />
        Bringing depth and texture where once there was void<br />
        This world was made for art<br />
        And to bring meaning to the living
